Collecting and analyzing weather is a crucial part of all meteorological departments; this mainly includes collecting data such as Temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. One of the easiest ways to visualize these three is by plotting polar plots. These take wind direction and windspeed, plot them in a polar plot, and then colour-code the bin according to the Temperature.
<br>
To achieve these colour-coded polar plots, the Openair package is used; this package is usually used to visualize the concentration of pollutants in the air, but by switching the pollutant with Temperature, the same result can be achieved for temperature-coded plots.
<br>
Along with polar plots, there is also code for simple mean temperatures and percentage changes is temperatures and wind speed.
<br>
The data is stored in an ncd file so an ncdf readed is also installed which can be skipped.

the end plots look like this.
